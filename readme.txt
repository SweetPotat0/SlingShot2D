SlignShot2D is a 2D Game, and our final project in game design course, as part of our computer science degree.

Here is part of the game's story:
Once upon a time, in a faraway land, there was a magical ball named Bouncy.
Bouncy was not an ordinary ball, but a ball with a mission.
Bouncy's mission was to find the lost key to the high tower and save the pricess.

You are playing as a ball, and your mission is to go through all the levels, eventually reaching the heighest tower and get to the princess.
You have special abilities you can earn through the levels.
The fastest you pass a level the better you are.
You can save checkpoints by going through the orange star.
